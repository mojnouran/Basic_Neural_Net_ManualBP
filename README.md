# Neural Nets Project

This repository contains MATLAB implementations of various neural network architectures, all developed from scratch with manual backpropagation. The project includes Radial Basis Function (RBF) autoencoders, Rough-set based autoencoders, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) autoencoders, Elman and Jordan recurrent neural networks (RNNs) along with their hybrids, and a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with explainable gradient monitoring. These implementations emphasize the underlying mechanics of neural networks, making them valuable for educational purposes and research exploration.

## Installation

To run these MATLAB scripts, ensure you have the following:

- **MATLAB** (version R2020a or later recommended)
- No additional toolboxes are strictly required, as all implementations are coded from scratch. However, the **Deep Learning Toolbox** or **Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox** may be useful for testing or extending the code.

Clone this repository to your local machine using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/neural-nets-project.git
